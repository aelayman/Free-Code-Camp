    <div class="h2">Who is Serge Voronoff?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was a French surgeon of Russian extraction who gained fame for his technique of grafting monkey testicle tissue on to the testicles of men for purportedly therapeutic purposes. 
    </div>
    <div class="h2">What did he do? 
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">Voronoff performed many strange procedures including injecting himself under the skin with extracts from ground-up dog and guinea pig testicles and transplanting thyroid glands from chimpanzees to humans with thyroid deficiencies. He moved on to transplanting the testicles of executed criminals into millionaires, but, when demand outstripped supply, he turned to using monkey testicle tissue instead. He carried out over five hundred transplantations on sheep and goats, and also on a bull, grafting testicles from younger animals to older ones. He rose to fame when he began transplanting monkey glands into humans. Thin slices (a few millimetres wide) of testicles from chimpanzees and baboons were implanted inside the patient's scrotum, the thinness of the tissue samples allowing the foreign tissue to fuse with the human tissue eventually. His later work included transplants of monkey ovaries into women. He also tried the reverse experiment, transplanting a human ovary into a female monkey, and then tried to inseminate the monkey with human sperm. To cope with the demand for the operation, Voronoff even set up his own monkey farm, employing a former circus-animal keeper to run it.
    </div>
    <div class="h2">When was he Prominent?
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph">His first official transplantation of a monkey gland into a human took place on June 12, 1920. By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world. His monkey-gland treatment was even featured in vogue in the 1920s.
    </div>
    <div class="h2">Where did he Practice?
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph">Voronoff's main clinic was located in Paris, France where he occupied the whole of the first floor of one of Paris's most expensive hotels, surrounded by a retinue of chauffeurs, valets, personal secretaries and two mistresses. He also had special clinics set up in distant places like Algiers, Algeria. His monkey farm was located on the Italian Riviera.
    </div>
    <div class="h2">Why was he motivated?
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph">He was motivated by the possibility of "rejuvinating" old men. Based on his early transplant experiments with animals in which he found older animals to regain the vigor of younger animals after grafting testicles from younger animals to older ones, he believed the potential effects of his surgery to include increased sex drive, better memory, the ability to work longer hours, the potential for no longer needing glasses (due to improvement of muscles around the eye), and the prolonging of life. Voronoff also speculated that the grafting surgery might be beneficial to people with "dementia praecox", the mental illness known today as schizophrenia.
    </div>
    <div class="h2">How did he Lose Respect?
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph">Voronoff's experiments ended following pressure from a skeptical scientific community and a change in public opinion after it became clear that his operations did not produce any of the results he claimed. In his book The Monkey Gland Affair, David Hamilton, an experienced transplant surgeon, discusses how animal tissue inserted into a human would not be absorbed, but instantly rejected. At best, it would result in scar tissue, which might fool a person into believing the graft is still in place. Interestingly, this means the many patients who received the surgery and praised Voronoff were "improved" solely by the placebo effect.
